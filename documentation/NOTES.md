- Electron doesn't follow normal Semver, but follows Chromium versions, so it might be beneficial to install a specific version of electron
- Many of Electron's core modules are Node.js event emitters that adhere to Node's asynchronous event-driven architecture. (source: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app#calling-your-function-when-the-app-is-ready)
- Node's `process.platform` variable can help you to run code conditionally on certain platforms. Note that there are only three possible platforms that Electron can run in: win32 (Windows), linux (Linux), and darwin (macOS).
